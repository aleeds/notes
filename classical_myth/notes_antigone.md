Antigones brothers: Eteokles and Polyneives

Hegel loves the Antigone:
  "Creon is not a tyrant, but a moral power.
   He is not wrong, he suggests that the
   government shuld be obeyed. Both arguments
   are shown to be wrong, in part because they are so 
   unyielding and one sided. Both are also right
   because they are shown to have moral weight."

Antigone and Creon are the powers at play.
