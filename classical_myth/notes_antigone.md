Antigones brothers: Eteokles and Polyneives

Hegel loves the Antigone:
  "Creon is not a tyrant, but a moral power.
   He is not wrong, he suggests that the
   government shuld be obeyed. Both arguments
   are shown to be wrong, in part because they are so 
   unyielding and one sided. Both are also right
   because they are shown to have moral weight."

Antigone and Creon are the powers at play.

Chorus Line 335: People can do lots of things, master of nature
                 and animals, and cities. This mastery can lead
                 to evil or to good. You can only avoid tragedy
                 if you follow the law of the gods and the law
                 of man. 

According to Creon, only when the government/state/city is doing well
can we have friends. When Creon decsribes how the brother of antigone should
be treated, he is echoing back to the description of the mistreatment of hector.

Law of the Gods and the Law of Man should be balanced.
